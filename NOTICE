-------------------

The code in this repository is based on the CIR repository at

Additions/modifications to existing code were made in the following locations:

- demo_batch.py and test_batch.py are based on demo.py and test.py from the repository mentioned above. Changes were
  made to batch-process all detections in an image at once instead of iterating over the object detections. Additionally,
  flags for activating the intersection constraint, using ground truth masks, and processing the synpick dataset were
  added.
- The following source files were added compared to the CIR repository:
   convert_mesh_to_sdf.py
   additional_scripts/run_gcpr24_eval.py
   additional_scripts/eval_penetration_errors.py
   additional_scripts/eval_penetration_scores.py
   additional_scripts/splits_to_targets.py
   cir/utils/geom/intersection_ops.py
- All other source files originate from the CIR repository. We modified the following files (see the files for details
  on the modifications):
   cir/datasets/bop.py
   cir/pose_models/raftse3.py
   cir/utils/geom/ba.py
   cir/utils/augmentation.py
   cir/utils/pt_renderer.py

The following files in the CIR repository were adapted from https://github.com/lukemelas/EfficientNet-PyTorch by the CIR

For evaluation, we rely on code from the bop toolkit at
https://github.com/thodan/bop_toolkit/tree/37d79c4c5fb027da92bc40f36b82ea9b7b197f1d, licensed under the MIT license
(see https://github.com/thodan/bop_toolkit/tree/37d79c4c5fb027da92bc40f36b82ea9b7b197f1d/LICENSE)
The file additional_scripts/bop_toolkit.patch is intended to patch the bop toolkit repo at the specified commit and
contains code snippets from the repository.
